# Writing Web Applications - Wiki written in Go

This example project simply followed the official tutorial
[Writing Web Applications](https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/).

_It may be slightly different from the original (more comments etc.)._

## How to get and run this example

<pre>
  $ git clone https://github.com/rideee/writing-web-applications-wiki-in-go
  $ cd writing-web-applications-wiki-in-go
  $ go mod tidy
  $ go run .
</pre>

## Troubleshooting

### **[Error]** go: modules disabled by GO111MODULE=off (...)

Error occurs when using 'go mod tidy':

<pre>
  $ go mod tidy
  go: modules disabled by GO111MODULE=off; see 'go help modules'
</pre>

It means that your **GO111MODULE**
[environment variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) is
set to **off**.

You can check this using:

<pre>
  $ go env
  GO111MODULE="off"
  GOARCH="amd64"
  GOBIN=""
  ...
</pre>

### What is GO111MODULE?

> From **Go version 1.11**, the way to deal with modules was **revamped**.
>
> Beforehand, it was required that you place all your Go code under a $GOPATH.
> Which many Go developers didnâ€™t much like, as it seemed chaotic at best.
>
> Also, having a package management/module management solution is so much more
> productive, and manageable.

  $ go help modules
  Modules are how Go manages dependencies.

  A module is a collection of packages that are released, versioned, and
  distributed together. Modules may be downloaded directly from version control
  repositories or from module proxy servers.

  For a series of tutorials on modules, see
  https://golang.org/doc/tutorial/create-module.

  For a detailed reference on modules, see https://golang.org/ref/mod.

  By default, the go command may download modules from https://proxy.golang.org.
  It may authenticate modules using the checksum database at
  https://sum.golang.org. Both services are operated by the Go team at Google.
  The privacy policies for these services are available at
  https://proxy.golang.org/privacy and https://sum.golang.org/privacy,
  respectively.

  The go command's download behavior may be configured using GOPROXY, GOSUMDB,
  GOPRIVATE, and other environment variables. See 'go help environment'
  and https://golang.org/ref/mod#private-module-privacy for more information.

### Solution

The easiest way to fix the problem is to set **GO111MODULE** environment
variable to **auto**, using **go env** command (like below), then verify also by
using **go env**:

<pre>
  $ go env -w GO111MODULE=auto
  $ go env
  GO111MODULE="auto"
  GOARCH="amd64"
  GOBIN=""
  ...
</pre>
